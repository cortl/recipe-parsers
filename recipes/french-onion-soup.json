    "instructions": [
        "Cut both ends of the onion off and slice into halves. Slice thinly perpendicular to the rings of the onion.",
        "Bring a large pot or enameled dutch oven to medium heat and add the 3Tbsp of butter + the 1Tbsp of olive oil. Once the butter begins to bubble, add the onions and season with salt to draw out the moisture from the onions.",
        "Stir gently but frequently as to not burn or mash the onions as they carmelize. Optionally add a small pinch of sugar to aid in the caramelization process. They should reach a solid brown color before they're done.",
        "De-glaze the pot with 2Tbsps of bourbon and wait until it reduces until there is barely any left - about 2 minutes",
        "Then add 1 1/4 white wine and wait until it reduces by about 70% - around 5 minutes",
        "Add 1.5 quarts of GOOD beef stock, season with salt and bring to a simmer, add the thyme and simmer for 20-30 minutes",
        "(Optionally) Add the dry sherry on top and let it simmer off the alcohol for 1-2 minutes",
        "Discard the thyme and add 2Tbsp of butter until fully melted. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Grate the gouda and gruyere, mix on a plate",
        "Brush 1/2 inch slice baguette with olive oil and toast in a 425 degree oven until crisp but not brown - ~5 minutes.",
        "Ladel soup into oven safe bowls, top with two slices of toasted baguette, and a generous helping of cheese. Broil for 2-3 minutes."
