  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash your potatoes well, then cut them into 3/4-inch cubes or pieces.",
    "Place the potatoes in a large bowl and add the olive oil, minced garlic, dried rosemary, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 15 cranks of a pepper mill). Toss the potatoes until they are evenly coated in oil and spices.",
    "Spread the potatoes out over a baking sheet so that they are in a single layer. Transfer the potatoes to the oven and roast for 15 minutes, then stir and roast for an additional 15 minutes.",
    "After 30 minutes total roasting time, stir once again and if additional browning is desired, roast for an additional 5-10 minutes. Serve with a handful of fresh, chopped parsley sprinkled over top, if desired.",
    "In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill). ",
    "Place the chicken thighs on a cutting board and pat dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the chicken, coating both sides liberally.",
    "Heat a large skillet over medium. Once hot, add the olive oil and swirl to coat. Add the coated chicken and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until cooked through and the brown sugar has turned into a deep brown glaze. Serve hot."
